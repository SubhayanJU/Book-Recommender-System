# Book-Recommender-System


This project involves building a comprehensive book recommendation system using machine learning techniques. It features two key components:

1. **Top 50 Rated Books**: The system analyzes a dataset of books and generates a list of the top 50 books based on their ratings. This helps users quickly discover highly rated books.

2. **Predictive Similar Book Recommender**: In addition to the top-rated list, the system includes a predictive model that, when given the title of a book, provides recommendations for 4 similar books. This feature is designed to enhance the user experience by offering personalized suggestions based on the input book.

### Project Workflow:

- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
- **Feature Engineering**: Important features such as book title, author, genre, and ratings are extracted and utilized to build the recommendation system.
- **Modeling**: A combination of content-based filtering and collaborative filtering is employed for making recommendations.
  - **Content-Based Filtering**: The model uses the attributes of the books (such as genre and author) to recommend books similar to the input.
  - **Collaborative Filtering**: This technique leverages user rating data to identify books that are often rated similarly.
- **Cosine Similarity**: The system employs cosine similarity to measure the similarity between books for the recommendation engine.

### Key Features:

- **Top 50 Book Ratings**: Users can view a curated list of the best-rated books.
- **Similar Book Recommendations**: Input one book title, and receive 4 personalized book suggestions based on similarity.

### Technologies Used:

- **Python**: For data analysis and model building.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation.
- **Scikit-learn**: For model development and cosine similarity.

### Future Improvements:

- Incorporate user-based collaborative filtering to enhance the recommendation accuracy.
- Introduce a user interface (UI) for easier interaction.
- Add personalized recommendations based on user preferences or reading history.
